This Python software simulates a therapy session. It’s meant for fun and entertainment, not as a substitute for professional therapy. If you’re seeking real help, please consult a qualified therapist.

To run the provided Python code, follow these steps:

1. **Install TextBlob**:
    - If you haven't already installed TextBlob, you can do so using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
      ```
      pip install textblob
      ```
    - Additionally, download the necessary NLTK corpora by running:
      ```
      python -m textblob.download_corpora
      ```

2. **Run the Code**:
    - Open your preferred Python environment (such as an IDE or Jupyter Notebook).
    - Copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., `therapist_chat.py`).
    - Execute the script.
    - You'll be prompted to input messages. The code will analyze the sentiment of each input and respond accordingly.
    - Type "end" to finish the session.
